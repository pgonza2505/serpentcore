# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The bot is actively maintained and security updates apply to the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest  | ✔️        |

Older releases are not guaranteed to receive patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, contact me directly at:

**andy.gonzalez0205@gmail.com**  
(or GitHub private security advisories)

I will review and respond as soon as possible.

## Security Considerations

- This project follows best practices for handling secrets and tokens.  
- The bot should always run using **environment variables** and never hard-coded secrets.  
- If you deploy on a VPS or Raspberry Pi, ensure the system is up to date and SSH is secured.

## Note

Please give me as much detail as possible when reporting security issues so I can reproduce the problem and patch it quickly.
